          This was my first website created for ART365, Design for the WWW, taken during Summer 2017.
          The purpose of the site was to act as a landing page for the remainder of the exercises and
          projects we would be completing over the course of the semester.

          This was my second website created for ART365, Design for the WWW, taken during Summer 2017.
          We were tasked with redesigning an existing information heavy website. I chose
          <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/">Baseball Prospectus</a> to redesign. The website, aside from the general content and images, was built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

        <h3>Website #3</h3>
        <a href="http://tigerweb.towson.edu/acaldw5/proj_3/index.html"><img src="web3.png" alt="Image of third webpage design project." />

        <p>
          This was my third website created for ART365, Design for the WWW, taken during Summer 2017. The aim was to create an
          original, full-fledged website based on a hobby or something we were interested in. I chose to make a
          website centered around covering video game news related to the Nintendo Switch. The website, aside from the general content and images, was built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
